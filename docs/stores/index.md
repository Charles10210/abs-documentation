# Introduction

Stores Module addresses Intranet's functionalities on inventory management, consumables, tools and their shelf life.

Before you begin, there are some topics that you need to have a general understanding. It is advised that you read this introduction first:

## Traceability

In aviation, all parts, tools and consumables all require proper documentation and traceability from the birth to cradle. All items must have associated paper works, part numbers, serial numbers and manufacturer batch numbers and must be easily identifiable. Although quite rare, manufacturers may find defects in their products' workmanship and need to recall them.

With proper documentation, we can quickly identify in which component, on which aircraft, the parts were installed.

These items play crucial roles in the airworthiness and safe operation of aircraft. In the past, a single wrong-sized screw unknowingly installed had caused a catastrophe.

**Suspected Unapproved Parts** or **SUP** is a training subject that addesses the importance of using treaceable, approved parts against fake ones.

Aircraft is made of metal, specifically aluminium (you may call it aluminum), at least the conventional one and until recently. Spare parts however, come in many meterials, plastic, steel, carbon or rubber. Each requires different care and storage conditions.

## Storage conditions

Unless required otherwise, all spare parts and consumables should be kept in a cool and dry place with controlled temperature and humidity. Suggested temperature is **not more than 25Â°c**.

## Shelf life

Some spart parts and most of the consumables do have life limitation. This is normally described in the labels, certificates of conformant, or TDS.

::: danger
**Using expired items is strictly forbidden**. Storeman and part users must actively look for shelf life of items being use. As a rule of thumb, keep in mind that _everything has an expiration and probably already expired_.

## Labels

All items, really, everything in Airborne Support must have appropriate identifying labels in the form of stickers. A label should be able to at least identify the item by its part number, serial number - if any, ABS batch number or OEM batch number.

In case of life limited items, a _red_ shelf life label is needed together with ID label. Integrated label - ID and shelf life - is currently not approved by MOE.

Label examples:

::: warning
**DO NOT USE** any item without a ID label
:::

::: warning
**TAKE CAUTIONS** on any item without expiration label
