# Stores

## Introduction

Stores Module addresses Intranet's functionalities on inventory management, consumables, tools and their shelf life.

Before you begin, there are some topics that you need to have a general understanding. It is advised that you read this introduction first:

### Traceability

In aviation, all parts, tools and consumables all require proper documentation and traceability from the birth to cradle. All items must have associated paper works, part numbers, serial numbers and manufacturer batch numbers and must be easily identifiable. Although quite rare, manufacturers may find defects in their products' workmanship and need to recall them.

With proper documentation, we can quickly identify in which component, on which aircraft, the parts were installed.

These items play crucial roles in the airworthiness and safe operation of aircraft. In the past, a single wrong-sized screw unknowingly installed had caused a catastrophe.

**Suspected Unapproved Parts** or **SUP** is a training subject that addesses the importance of using treaceable, approved parts against fake ones.

### Storage conditions and shelf life limitation

Aircraft is made of metal, specifically aluminium (you may call it aluminum), at least the conventional one and until recently. Spare parts however, come in many meterials, plastic, steel, carbon or rubber. Each requires different care and storage conditions.

#### Storage

Unless required otherwise, all spare parts and consumables should be kept in a cool and dry place with controlled temperature and humidity. Suggested temperature is **not more than 25Â°c**.

#### Shelf life

Some spart parts and most of the consumables do have life limitation. This normally states in their labels, certificates of conformant, or TDS.

> **Using expired items is strictly forbidden**. Storemen and part users must actively look for shelf life of items being use. As a rule of thumb, keep in mind that _everything has an expiration_.

This module is further broken down to multiple submodules:

- [Spares](/stores/#spares)
- [Tires Management](/stores/#tires)
- [Tools](/stores/tool.md)
- [Consumables](/stores/#consumables)
- [Scraps]('/stores/#scraps)

## Spares

This module deals with items that will be installed onto components and have part numbers and possibly serial numbers. Spares include nuts, bolts, o-rings (packings), but do not include grease, paint, oil or lube.

## Tires

Initially included in Spares module, tires require a lot of storage space and move through inventory in bi-direction manner, e.g. removed from wheels and kept in another storage. The tires then given its own module to manage.

Tires module deals with receiving of new tires from both customers and vendors.

### Receive new tires

1. Click `+ TIRES` to open a dialog.
1. Enter customer code, e.g. VZ, and receiving date.
1. In the dropdown menu select tire part number, serial number and R level then click `+`. All fields must be completed.
1. Review the list then click `SUBMIT`
1. The dialog should disappear. The tire list will repopulate.

### Receive new tires by uploading `.csv` file

In case the vendors provide an `excel` or `.csv` file containing all the tires, you can upload the file and let the system add them for you, saving you time.

Clear instructions are displayed on the dialog, but here's the content:

> Instructions:
>
> - Prepare a .csv file containing the tires.
> - If the first row is the header row: make sure the headers contain [ "PartNo", "SerialNo", "RD_Level" ], in any order.
>   If the file was prepared by Bridgestone, it should already contain the required data without requiring you to modify it, except saving it as .csv .
>   Added/received tires will allow user to pick the tire to add to a work order.
> - If the .csv does not have header row: the .csv must contain only the following in this order. "partnumber", "serialnumber", "recap"
> - Use only number for retread level, for example: "APR07010", "Z186H102", "0".
> - You will have a chance to review the data before uploading it.

After uploading the file, you will be giving a chance to review the data before saving.

### Edit tires

1. Click on the `ID` or `pen` icon of the tire that needs modification.

## Tools

This module is one of the most advanced modules in the system.

## Consumables

## Scraps
